# 🧾 SkaFld Studio – Invoice App Challenge

Welcome to the SkaFld Studio technical challenge. This exercise is designed to test your practical skills across full-stack development, API handling, and modern tooling. It should take approximately **3–4 hours** to complete.

---

## 🧠 Objective
Build a basic invoicing app that allows users to **view**, **create**, **edit**, and **delete** invoice records. It should include both **frontend UI** and **backend data logic**.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Recommended)
You are free to use any stack, but we recommend:

- **Frontend**: React or Next.js (TypeScript preferred)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS or CSS Modules
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), or mock JSON API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (preferred) or GitHub Pages

---

## ✍️ Features to Implement

### Required
- [ ] Display a list of invoices
- [ ] Add new invoice (client name, amount, due date, status)
- [ ] Edit invoice fields
- [ ] Delete an invoice
- [ ] Store/retrieve data from Supabase (or similar backend)
- [ ] Responsive layout & basic UX polish

### Bonus
- [ ] Light/Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Search/filter by client name or status
- [ ] Auth via Supabase (mocked if needed)
- [ ] Reusable components
- [ ] Integration with Windsurf/Cursor agentic tooling

---

## 🚀 Submission Instructions

1. **Deploy your app** (e.g., to Vercel or similar)
2. **Push code to GitHub** (public repo)
3. **Submit this info via the provided form:**
   - GitHub repo URL
   - Live demo URL
   - Agentic tools used (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
   - File `agentic-dev.md` in your repo explaining how you used AI-native tooling (e.g., reflexes, custom prompts, automation chains)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: All core features implemented
- Code quality: Clarity, modularity, use of TypeScript
- UX: Intuitive and responsive UI
- Tooling: Use of modern dev stack
- Bonus: Usage of AI-native tooling like Cursor or Windsurf
