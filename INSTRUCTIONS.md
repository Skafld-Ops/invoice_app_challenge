# üßæ SkaFld Studio ‚Äì Invoice App Challenge

Welcome to the SkaFld Studio technical challenge. This exercise is designed to test your practical skills across full-stack development, API handling, and modern tooling. It should take approximately **3‚Äì4 hours** to complete.

---

## üß† Objective
Build a basic invoicing app that allows users to **view**, **create**, **edit**, and **delete** invoice records. It should include both **frontend UI** and **backend data logic**.

---

## üß± Tech Stack (Recommended)
You are free to use any stack, but we recommend:

- **Frontend**: React or Next.js (TypeScript preferred)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS or CSS Modules
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), or mock JSON API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (preferred) or GitHub Pages

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Features to Implement

### Required
- [ ] Display a list of invoices
- [ ] Add new invoice (client name, amount, due date, status)
